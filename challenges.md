### geometry
1. ~~area of rectangle (introduce structs)~~
2. perimiter
3. same for cube (area, volume)
4. now make it an array. eg we want to store an array of the details of all the planets (static)
5. add functions to get statistics about the planets. volume, maybe mass etc
6. now add the ability to create new planets (maybe dynamic?) (command line options) (linked list)
  6.1 the need for a linked list
  6.2 dynamic vs static memory
  6.3 command line options
7. consider moving this to a cpp file now?

### future
- program that takes a year and reports if it is a leap year or not
- program that takes a number of days then reports how many years, months, days it is
- program to print all numbers between 1 to 100 which divided by a specified number and the remainder will be 3

- find some challenges that do bitwise operations
- get arguments from command line to do something
- make guessing game (input a number. the further away, the worse the insult returned)
- print out how many bits each type in c uses and its max and min values
- collect a bunch of values then print them sorted numerically (talk about arrays, and memory allocation)
- then alphbaetically, using what was written numerically (talk about ascii)

radius of a circle = pi*r^2
