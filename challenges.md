### geometry
0. square a circle  
  0.1. user can input the radius of a circle  
  0.2. program must print the width of a square that has the same area as the circle  
1. area of rectangle (introduce structs)
2. perimiter
3. same for cube (area, volume)
4. now make it an array. eg we want to store an array of the details of all the planets (static)
5. add functions to get statistics about the planets. volume, maybe mass etc
6. now add the ability to create new planets (maybe dynamic?)

### future
- collect a bunch of values then print them sorted numerically (talk about arrays, and memory allocation)
- then alphbaetically, using what was written numerically (talk about ascii)
