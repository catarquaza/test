# geometry
- area of rectangle (introduce structs)
- perimiter
- same for cube (area, volume)
- now make it an array. eg we want to store an array of the details of all the planets (static)
- add functions to get statistics about the planets. volume, maybe mass etc
- now add the ability to create new planets (maybe dynamic?)

# collect a bunch of values then print them sorted numerically (talk about arrays, and memory allocation)
# then alphbaetically, using what was written numerically (talk about ascii)
